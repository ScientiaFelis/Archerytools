# Archerytools
Scripts to calculate data of arrows, such as total weight, FOC, and grains per pound for your bow.

### BASH Scripts

Add files to e.g. your `$HOME/bin/` folder. Make it executable:

`chmod +x $HOME/bin/ArrowData.sh`

The script will ask you for the data of your arrow and bow. There are some default values and these should be checked and changed accordingly.

-----------------------------

### PYTHON Script
This is similar to the bash-script. It asks quaestions on your arrow and bow ad calculate the data.
